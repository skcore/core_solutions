================================================

Map: Branches the middleware pipeline based on the request path.
MapGet: Defines middleware to handle HTTP GET requests for a specific path.
MapPost: Defines middleware to handle HTTP POST requests for a specific path.
Use: Adds middleware to the pipeline that runs for every request (and can pass control to the next middleware).
Run: Defines terminal middleware that handles the request and prevents further middleware from running.
MapWhen: Conditionally branches the middleware pipeline based on a custom condition.
UseWhen: Conditionally executes middleware based on a custom condition but returns to the main pipeline afterward.

================================================

UseFileServer: Adds a file server to the pipeline that serves static files from the wwwroot folder.
UseDefaultFiles: Adds middleware to the pipeline that looks for default files such as index.html or default.html.
UseStaticFiles: Adds middleware to the pipeline that serves static files from the specified directory.
UseDirectoryBrowser: Adds middleware to the pipeline that generates directory listings for directories without a default file.


================================================

Key Points:
app.Map creates a separate pipeline for the specified path (in your case, /testmap).
The middleware in the main pipeline won't be executed for the mapped path unless explicitly placed before the app.Map call.
To make sure middleware runs in both cases, place the app.Use middleware before the app.Map.

================================================

Run is used to terminate the middleware pipeline, ensuring that no other middleware runs after it.
Map creates a branch for certain routes and allows further middleware to run within 
that branch, but doesn't terminate the overall pipeline. You can still call middleware within the branch using next(), 
unless a Run is used within the branch to terminate it.

.NET 8 

ShortCircuit: This method allows specific endpoints to bypass the middleware pipeline, directly returning a response.
MapShortCircuit: This method defines multiple routes that should immediately return a specific response, 
such as a 404 Not Found, without further processing.
